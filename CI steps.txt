Maintain a code repository

	Version control
		Distributed - allows many software developers to work on a given project without requiring them to share a common network ; Git, Mercurial, DCVS ; 
		Centalized - a single “central” copy of your project somewhere (probably on a server) ; CVS, Subversion ; IBM Rational clearcase, Perforce, Team Foundation Server; 
		
Automate the build 

	compiling computer source code into binary code, packaging binary code, and running automated tests.
	Build automation utility – like Make, MS build, Ant, etc. Whose primary purpose is to generate build artifacts through activities like compiling and linking source code.
	Build automation servers – These are general web based tools that execute build automation utilities on a scheduled or triggered basis; a continuous integration server is a type of build automation server.

	On-demand automation 
	Scheduled automation
	Triggered automation
	Build tools -
	Ant; 
	Buildr; 
	Continuum - https://continuum.apache.org/features.html; 
	Maven; 
	AnthillPro; 
	Bamboo; 
	CruiseControl; 
	ElectricCommander; 
	Gradle;  
	Jenkins; 
	make; 
	JitPack;
	Buck;
	Pants;
	Capsule;
	Bazel;
	
Make the build self-testing

Commit to the baseline every day
Every commit should be built
Keep the build fast
Test in a clone of the production environment
Everyone can see the results of the latest build

Version control
task assigning
ide
changes
commits (pull req)
build 
test
integrate
test

Pattern	Run - a software build with every change applied to the Repository.
Anti-patterns - Scheduled builds, nightly builds, building periodically, building exclusively on developer's machines, not building at all.
